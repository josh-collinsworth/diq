![Not everyone cares about the things in life that are important to you, but a few people do, and if there's a more valuable thing a stranger can share with you, I don't know what it is.](/assets/images/Week_6-1080x720.png)

Today a friend I've never met passed away. He didn't know my name and wouldn't have recognized me if we passed on the street. The only thing that we shared was that he would talk about sports on TV and amidst the third down analysis and coverage of highlight plays a friendship was formed built on the foundation of how much we almost agreed.

One fewer sports analyst in the world may not mean anything to some and not everyone will share this sadness; We are all hollowed by different emptinesses.

Not everyone cares about the parts of life that are important to you, but a few people do and if there's a more valuable thing a stranger can share with you I don't know what it is.
