![A young boy in a vast expanse runs from a multitude of Tetris pieces as far as the eye can see pressing in on him in the darkness.](/assets/images/Week-13-2.jpg)

I don't think I realized this in the '90s when I spent my Saturday mornings dropping multicolored geometric shapes without end, but if you stop to think about it Tetris is a surprising apt analogy for life in general.

- The only way to get rid of your mistakes is to work diligently to turn them into opportunities.

- You have almost enough time to figure out what you’re doing before everything speeds up.

- Complaining doesn’t let you take a move back, nor will it make the next piece any better.

- Sometimes you get a piece that has no use and you have to figure out how to make it work anyway.

- Everyone hates a square.

- And above all else the pieces will always keep falling whether you're ready for them or not.

I admit that life isn't as entertaining as Tetris and that the soundtrack is frequently worse so the analogy isn't perfect, but neither is life most of the time.
