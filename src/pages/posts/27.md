![what a world it would be if we could only learn that there's more than one way  to be courageous.](/assets/images/Week-27.jpg)

"That's not brave" they say, "She's not being courageous" and usually these comments are alongside a picture of men in uniforms, one man missing both legs below the knee and another burned beyond recognition, adorned with the obvious signs of the price of valor.

And while I donâ€™t dispute the bravery of the soldier (the landmine he never saw) or the firefighter (the child was saved), but what a world it would be if we could only learn that there's more than one way to be courageous.
