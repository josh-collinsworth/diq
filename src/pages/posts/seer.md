![A cloaked and hooded shadowy figure lurks over a small village in the night of a dark, eerie forest, leaves blowing beneath the full moon overhead.](/assets/images/Week-12-Final.png)

A quiet town, on prairie found<br>
the gentle people sleeping.<br>
The dawn has come, the morning sun<br>
finds a gruesome secret keeping.<br>
The first to rise found a grim surprise:<br>
an arm and two bloody feet.<br>
The village woke to find Fred Oak<br>
ripped to pieces in the street.

With no passers through, the village knew<br>
the killer is one of us.<br>
And the paw prints found across the ground<br>
made everyone suspicious.<br>
Now many a year had passed by here<br>
since the legends first began;<br>
no one believed til this gruesome deed<br>
in wolves disguised as man.

The bite marks chewed in the wolf's dead food<br>
confirmed our fears were true:<br>
somewhere within family and friend,<br>
one of us was _loup garou_.<br>
Once blood was cleaned from the grizzly scene<br>
and Fred was proper buried,<br>
the entire town then gathered round<br>
so justice could be carried.

Between our kin, family and friends<br>
we'd never broken trust.<br>
But truth was out, there was no doubt:<br>
a killer was among us.<br>
We all were scared as we joined there<br>
each solemn and perplexed.<br>
But we all knew if the wolf's not slew<br>
Might any of us be next.

A silent crowd stared each other down;<br>
no one would speak the first.<br>
But the silence broke when the elder spoke<br>
and said "Waiting makes it worse.<br>
The daily sun is halfway done;<br>
soon moon will be overhead.<br>
The hungry beast again will feast<br>
unless first we kill him dead."

Then a sudden din as we all jumped in,<br>
each crying an accusation. <br>
Amid the noise, Sheriff raised his voice<br>
and halted the conversation.<br>
"We can shout all day, but that's not the way<br>
to sort out which is which.<br>
So gentle folk, I propose a vote<br>
to hang the son of a bitch."

Chilly with fear, no culprit clear<br>
it seemed our only prospect.<br>
So we each agreed, on count of three<br>
to point out our chosen suspect.<br>
With no other choice, in calm clear voice<br>
the Sheriff was the host.<br>
He counted three, each pointed we<br>
at the friend we suspected most.

When we counted votes we found the most<br>
were pointed at Sam O'Shallows.<br>
Protested he, "It wasn't me!"<br>
still we strung him from the gallows.<br>
Hanging from noose, his life was loosed<br>
his body twisted in the breeze.<br>
That deed now done, I think everyone<br>
was almost put to ease.

With daylight spent, to our homes we went<br>
and tucked our children into bed.<br>
That evil day, we could only pray<br>
that the wolf was truly dead.<br>
That night we found that the only sound<br>
was the hooting of the owls.<br>
Til midnight broke and I was awoke<br>
by a nearby creature's howls...
