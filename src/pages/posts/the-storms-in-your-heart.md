Clouds dissipate but are never gone; they’ll eventually gather again. And so it is with the storms in your heart: though hidden, they’re always within.

I’m proud to stand, to have endured; for the moment I’ve conquered the threat. Yet sometimes I fear that the best I can say is it hasn’t defeated me yet.
