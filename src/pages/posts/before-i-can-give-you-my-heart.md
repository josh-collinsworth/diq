It was your brown eyes that first caught my attention, and the symphonies of your voice that held me there, and I hope you won’t take it personal that I ran away.

It’s not fear of commitment nor is there some other girl; truth be told, I was worried about my brains. You see it’s just really bad timing, what with the swarm of zombies and the collapse of all civilization. If you have not been eaten yet then somewhere beneath the apocalypse moon maybe you too are looking skyward and thinking of what almost was.

Don’t let them eat your brains before I can give you my heart.
