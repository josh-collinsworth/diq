steady glow of the moon veiled by clouds of tonight you are how I feel

do you even notice us crowded poets slaving to describe you in ways abstract and beautiful so recent our arrival and the vapors of our ecosystem not the only clouds over our heads we too go largely unnoticed except by the things we orbit the universe is us and let us never forget as we pen our sonnets about the stars that beautiful as the night is between the clouds there is even more starlight during the day although it too must sometimes struggle through the clouds
