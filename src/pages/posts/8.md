![High above the clouds in a starry night sky, a solitary figure sits alone on a floating island, looking down, back turned to the burning bridge behind.](/assets/images/Week-8.jpg)

I sat down to write a funny and heartwarming poem about a box of kittens and a stodgy businessman and a mixup at the port authority but instead I'm thinking about a girl and how close her lips were that summer evening and how the same sun sets on different people every day of my life.

The regrets I cherish most are the things I didn't do.

And on the other side of the sunset another man I will think of as myself will face an identical struggle to write a poem about the courage I will or will not have, as unknown to me today as this poem was before the last sunset.
