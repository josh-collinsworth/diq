I like the world best at 6am  
because things are quiet  
and still  
and I have the emptiness of the streets  
all to myself.

By 7 the early early commuters are out

eating breakfast with one hand

and narrowly avoiding pedestrians

with the other

and by 8 the school buses roll

so children can learn the importance

of commuting during high traffic times

(the key to conformity is practice),

I like the world best at 6am  
when I still have the emptiness  
all to myself.
