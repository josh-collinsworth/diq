Think not of the

unpleasantness and stress

that the future may hold.

It's never the future

you're truly afraid of anyway;

itâ€™s reliving the past

that torments you.

But neither what has

nor what is

holds

any

power

over

you

now

(_without your permission_).

It's one of those truths

that is deeper than it is wide,

so easy to say

on

the

surface

but

too

true

to

learn

all

at

once.

The only time you have,

or will ever have

is right now.

  

No

matter

**what**

**

else

**

**happens**,

it's

always

right

now.
