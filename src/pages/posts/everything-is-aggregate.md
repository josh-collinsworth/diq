You don’t make a decision to run a marathon; you make thousands and thousands of decisions to run one more step.

And One Giant Leap For Mankind was really a million steps taken by a boy who loved the sky enough to walk to the moon.

The times when you stumble don’t matter as much as the times you don’t.
