It is Christmas season or, more relevantly, Christmas light season. I can remember packing them away very carefully last year in neat looping coils but still I sit cross-legged on the floor unknotting the requisite holiday cheer. It is not clear yet if everyone will make it home but itâ€™s important the house look magical just in case.

The truth of Christmas light season is no matter how careful you are you can never untangle quite all the knots.
