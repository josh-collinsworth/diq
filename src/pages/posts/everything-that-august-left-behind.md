June is such a lazy month; and Januaryâ€™s a bore. November is a lonely month May leaves me wanting more.

December tries too hard to please and April can't make up her mind; September will promise you everything that August left behind.

July's too hot, October's not, March is February with sun. The month that I accomplish things is clearly not the current one.
